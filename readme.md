# Important Notice

For new development, we encourage you to use the Verify API instead of the Authy API. The Verify API is an evolution of the Authy API with continued support for SMS, voice, and email one-time passcodes, an improved developer experience and new features.

Please visit the [Verify Quickstarts Page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/quickstarts) to get started with the Verify API. Thank you!


# Account Verification - Laravel
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-verification-laravel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TwilioDevEd/account-verification-laravel)

Use Authy and Twilio to verify your user's account.

[View the full tutorial here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/account-verification/php/laravel)!

### Run the application

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.

1. Install the application's dependencies with [Composer](//getcomposer.org/)

   ```bash
   $ composer install
   ```

1. The application uses PostgreSQL as the persistence layer. If you
   don't have it already, you should install it. The easiest way is by
   using [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/).

1. Create a database.

  ```bash
  $ createdb account_verification
  ```

1. Copy the sample configuration file and edit it to match your configuration.

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

  You can find your `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` under
  your
  [Twilio Account Settings](//www.twilio.com/user/account/settings).
  You can buy Twilio phone numbers at [Twilio numbers](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/search)
  `TWILIO_NUMBER` should be set to the phone number you purchased above.

  You must create an Authy app so you can get your API key, you can do this on
  your [Authy Dashboard](//dashboard.authy.com).

1. Generate an `APP_KEY`.

   ```bash
   $ php artisan key:generate
   ```

1. Run the migrations.

  ```bash
  $ php artisan migrate
  ```

1. Run the application using Artisan.

  ```bash
  $ php artisan serve
  ```

1. Go to the app's main page at http://localhost:8000

### Dependencies

This application uses the following Twilio helper library and PHP client for Authy:

* [twilio-php](//github.com/twilio/twilio-php)
* [authy-php](//github.com/authy/authy-php)

### Run the tests

1. Run at the top-level directory.

   ```bash
   $ phpunit
   ```

   If you don't have phpunit installed on your system, you can follow [these
   instructions](https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html) to
